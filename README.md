# Web Developer Portfolio

<h3>Used React.js, Three.js, React Three Fiber, Tailwind.css, Framer Motion to build Portfolio website,
including my projects so far, experience, links and 3D animations. </h3>

<h2>Goals: </h2>

<p>Through the process of creating this <strong>Portfolio</strong>, I got to know more about the <strong>Vite.js</strong> tool for an even better dev experience, then I used the <strong>Three.js</strong> <i>3D JavaScript library</i> for the first time, where I learned to implement 3D solutions on my website and familiarized myself with the functionality of the library itself. I would also like to mention that I used the <strong>Tailwind.css</strong> framework and its features by following the official documentation.</p>
